# Mod-Manager
### a simple mod manager that allows you to easily switch between different mods without having a separate instance of Minecraft


You have to have **Python** installed. It will probably work with any modern version but use version **3.11.4** to avoid any issues



Place the **Mod Manager.pyw** into the games root directory (`%userprofile%\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft`) and if you have Python installed you can double-click it to launch it.

you can create a shortcut if you want.
